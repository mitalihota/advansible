Handlers:-
other programming language we use funstion,Inside ansible if you want to write separate funstions then go for handlers.Generally it acts as a trigger,we have two section one is task other is handler in playbook.
whenever there is a change by executing a task,then it create a trigger
eg-edited something in configuration file then state changed lead a trigger (by notify)stmt to restart that particular service.its achieved by handler inside ansible
concept-
is a trigger which take care of running an event in case of action is actually happening.
NOTE-
--> Handler section will be executed only after completing all the main tasks.
--> Handler will be executed in sequence as specified in the handler section.
-->if the same handler is called multiple times handler will be executed only once .
